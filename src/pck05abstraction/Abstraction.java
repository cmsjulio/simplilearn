/*

    when you want to hide details of a particular object to the outside world;
    ex.: when you git the gas in a car, it moves forward, even tho there is much more going on under the hood;
    abstract serves us as a way to hide details from the user -- thus providing a simpler interface.

    -

    abstract is the keyword that can be used in front of a class or a method;
    when in front of a class, the whole class becomes abstract.
    abstract classes cannot be instanciated (invoked) but yet they can be subclassed.
    when you add the abstract keyword in front of a method, the method is only declared withou an implementation, you only declare the method.
    is the responsibility of the child class to implement the abstract methods.

/*

  advanced concept;
  sometimes we need to provide metadata information to Java;
  we dont want to code everything, but we want to give smarter instructions to Java so that it understands what to do.

  we provide some shorthand metadata information about the program to the Java compiler.

  they provide additional logic to the code.

  Focus:
    -provide information to the compiler;
    -compile-time and deployment-time processing;
    -provide instruction for runtime processing;

    for example:
    while the program may compile without @Override, by annotating it, Java will know from the start what it is dealing with,
      thus saving compiler processing time.

    Shorthand providing instruction to the compiler.
